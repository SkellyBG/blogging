o/ This is my first blog!!

So.. I finAlly bit the bullet and decided that pure leetcoding was the saddest thing I can do. I kinda also needed a space to write down all My thoughts after puzzle hunts and events anyway (sneaky peek at future pOst!?) so here we are.

## So, why Jekyll?
You see, for the past year, I've been goiNg through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP for short), to learn HTML, CSS and JS. I thouGht I could make everything from scratch - damn past me was dumb. You know, having a personal website would be sort of useless if I finished it by 2028, so I looked for a solUtion that can get me started straight away - and landed on Jekyll! I am definitely a noob to this though, so my next task will be to make my webSite not a blank template.

## Easter eggs?
Easter eggs.
